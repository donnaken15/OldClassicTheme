The program has been compiled using :
 — Microsoft CL & CL64 compiler version 16.00.40219.01 and linker version 10.00.40219.01;
 — Microsoft Windows SDK v. 7.1 headers and libraries;
 — Microsoft Windows DDK v. 7600.16385.1 libraries;
 — Native-NT-Toolkit headers.

After setting the environment variables INCLUDE (mine is “C:\WINSDK\v7.1\Include;C:\WINSDK\ndk”) and LIB (mine is “C:\WINSDK\v7.1\Lib”), run :
 — “build_dwmapi.bat”;
 — “build64.bat”;
 — “build.bat”.

Please don't pay attention to the bad code; I am not a professional programmer and this is just a “proof of concept”…
